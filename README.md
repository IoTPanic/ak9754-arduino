# AK9754

Arduino library for the AK9754 was started from the shell of the [Sparkfun AK975x](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_AK975x_Arduino_Library) library which is not compatible with the AK9754. This repo shares the same MIT license as the sparkfun library.

_This library was made for RemindMe and on their time._
